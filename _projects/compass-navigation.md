This app is one of my personal projects. It is a compass navigation app for
Android Wear smartwatches. The user can enter a destination on his phone and
then use his watch to navigate. A compass points to his destination.

This project gave me the opportunty to try some new approaches as I had full autonomy.
Thus, I even did the design work and created all graphic assets by myself.

You can find the app [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wearnavigation&referrer=utm_source%homepage)
and the landing page [here](http://www.wearnavigation.com).
