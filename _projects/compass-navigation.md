This app is one of my personal projects. It is a compass navigation app for
Android Wear smart watches. The user can enter a destination on the phone and
then use a smart watch to navigate. A compass points to the destination.

This project gave me the opportunity to try some new approaches in terms of
technology and design as I had full autonomy.

The app is available on the Google Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wearnavigation&referrer=utm_source%20portfolio)
and there is a landing page [here](http://www.wearnavigation.com).
