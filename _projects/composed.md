  For 13 months, I have worked on the Composed classical music streaming app being the only Android
  developer in the Composed product team.

Composed is an innovative niche digital music streaming service and is a subsidiary of Universal Music, the owner of the largest classical music catalogue on the planet.

Being part of a small autonomous product team I've been responsible for the Composed Android app for 13 months.
I've implemented several new features like a new audio playback component or composer playlists.
Because of the small size of the Composed product team I was able to help with different
product related tasks like user research or customer data analysis.
