Composed was a niche digital streaming service for classical music and a subsidiary of Universal Music. Unfortunately, the service has been shut down after two years in mid 2016.

Being part of a small autonomous product team I've been responsible for the Composed Android app for 13 months.
I've implemented several new features like a new audio playback component or composer playlists.
Because of the small size of the Composed product team I was able to help with different
product related tasks like user research or customer data analysis.
