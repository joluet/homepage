  This is one of my personal projects. It is a small utility app that helps finding
  car sharing cars and saving money.

The FuelMeUp app displays car sharing vehicles of [Drive-Now](https://uk.drive-now.com/) and [Car2Go](https://www.car2go.com) on a map and filters them by fuel level.

With these two services customers can earn bonus minutes by fueling up a car after the fuel level has been below a certain threshold. The main idea of this app is to spot cars with a low fuel level so you can fuel them up and earn bonus minutes.

I used this app to try new some new technical approaches like dependency injection with _Dagger_ and the MVP architecture.

The app is available on the Google Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.fuelmeup).
I published the source code on [github](https://github.com/fuel-me-up/fuel-me-up-android).
