MondoAndroid is an unofficial Android client for [Mondo](http://www.getmondo.co.uk/) — a bank that provides an API. This app features a transaction feed and sends notifies the user for new transactions. I'm going to extend this app with budget tracking features as the Mondo API evolves.

This is an open source project on [Github](https://github.com/joluet/MondoAndroid).
