[Monzo](https://monzo.com) is a start up bank that is reinventing retail banking. They want to make banking simple and effortless by providing a well designed and carefully crafted app that gives their customers all the information and control they need.

As Monzo's first Android developer I've built the first version of the Monzo Android app. The implementation follows an MVP pattern and uses RxJava with Retrofit and Realm to achieve a reactive architecture. This structure facilitated unit and UI testing and has allowed us to release new features very quickly.  
I also helped hiring two more Android developers at Monzo.
