At Ostmodern I helped building the [BBC Player](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bbc.tve&hl=en) video on demand streaming app for <em>BBC World Wide</em>. This app is an international version of the famous <em>BBC iPlayer</em> app that is only available in the UK. It lets users browse and watch video content which is provided by BBC.

Working with two less experienced Android developers I had the chance to share some of my knowledge whilst making most of the major architectural decisions. The implementation follows an MVP pattern and uses RxJava with Retrofit and Realm to achieve a reactive architecture. This structure facilitated unit and UI testing.
