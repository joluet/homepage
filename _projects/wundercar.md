  Being part of the Wunder engineering team I developed the initial
  version of the Wunder ride sharing app.
---
[Wunder](http://www.wunder.org/) is a German start up that provides a ride sharing service similar to Uber.
It is more focused on the community aspect of ride sharing, though.

For six months I've worked at Wunder and helped building the Wunder Android app.
In a team of two Android developers we managed to release the first version of this app
after two months. We then improved the app in quick iterations based on user feedback and data.
